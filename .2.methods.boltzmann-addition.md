# Boltzmann addition

The formula  of Boltzmann addition looks very similar to Boltzmann multiplication,
with the product being replaced by a sum:

$$ p_t(s_t, a[i]) = \sum_j \pi_t^j (s_t, a[i]) $$

As concept however,
it is a variant of rank voting where $ r_t^j=\pi_t^j $.
The ensemble policy for actions selection is calculated in the same way as Boltzmann multiplication:

$$ \pi_t (s_t, a[i]) = \frac{ p_t(s_t, a[i])^{\frac{1}{\tau}}}{\sum_k p_t(s_t, a[k])^{\frac{ 1 }{\tau}}} $$

Boltzmann Addition. As a last method, we can also sum
the action selection probabilities of the different algorithms.
Essentially, this is a variant of rank voting, using r t j = Ï€ t j .
The preference values of the ensemble are:
