Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning. 
Software agents need to learn from experience which actions to take in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
The interactions and decisions the agent takes depend on the state of the environment.																
In return the environment provides to the agent a reward which might be positve or negative. 
The agent seeks, through iterative experiences the optimal solution by  maximizes the sum of rewards over time.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) are sometimes combined with ensemble methods to do best and good thinks in a short time. 
And it is in this logic that we have chosen to work on the one paper name " Ensemble Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning".
			
Into the present paper we will show that several ensemble methods such as: 
Majority Voting (VM), Rank Voting, Boltzmann mulplication(BM) and Boltzmann Addition(BA) 
combine multiple different Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms which are: 
Q-Learning, Sarsa, Actor-Critic(AC), QV-Learning, and AC Learning Automaton in a single agent and the aim is to perform learning speed and final performance. 
We show  experiments on five maze problems of varying complexity.

			
Ensemble methods are very powerful and appropriate in the sense that when combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, 
they perform learning speed and final performance  when applied for solving different control problems.
						
In another paper such as  Ensemble Methodes for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation[1], 
ensemble methods have been combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithsms.
In this paper ideas are the same like the  work that we have  elaborated with. 
The only difference that it do not have the same method as our. 
Also In this paper they describe several ensemble methods that 
combine multiple reinforcement learning algorithms for multiple agents.
For that the Temporal-Difference(TD) and  Residual-Gradient(RG) update methods 
as well as a policy function have been used . 
These two methods must be combined to the policy function 
and have been be applied to the simple pencil-and-paper game (Tic-Tac-Toe ). 
They showed that an ensemble of three agents outperforms a single agent. 
Furthermore, they performed an experiment to learn the shortest path on  a 20×20 maze.
The purpose of applying ensemble methods on games to show that the learning speed is faster. 
			
Further another paper namely: The QV Family Compared to Other Reinforcement Learning Algorithms[2]
do not combine Methodes and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithsms.
This paper compare new Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithsms such as QV2 with others Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithsms 
well known as: Q-Learning, Sarsa, Actor-Critic(AC), QV-Learning,  Actor-Critic.
These comparaison are made on  different maze tasks and the aim is to know whether there exit 
a large difference in term of performance between algorithms when they are applied to a problem And also to know if 
an algorithm perform better than others. 
			
			
				
			
			
			
			
REMARKS:

* Need more citations (let say around 10)
	- you dont need to read the whole papers, you can see to what the papers you read refer to themselve and use thiss
	- read abstracts and quickly check some facts
* I dont understand what you mean by 
	"Reinforcement Learning (RL) are sometimes combined with ensemble methods to do best and good thinks in a short time."
	Explain inother way
* It is good to introduce what we did in this paper (second paragraph), but do this in the last paragraphs.
	This way there is a fluent transition into the method section
* Make the paragraph about ensemble methods bigger, explain more what it is and what the advantages and disadvantages are
* In paragraph about other work you say:
	"The only difference that it do not have the same method as our"
	Exactly explain the differences and the consequences of these differences
* also highlight that they make an ensemble of multiple agents and we did an ensemble within the same agent
* you say:
	"The purpose of applying ensemble methods on games to show that the learning speed is faster. "
	Did they also observe this after the experiments?
	if so, say that they concluded or observed an increase in learning speed
	I not, say they did not observe that, even though they expected it to improve the learnign speed, explain why
* In the last paragraph you tell about what they did, that is good, but you also have to talk about the conclusions they found
	- In general you should do
		+ repeat the main question they were asking themselve 
		+ shortly explain the experimental setup, how they solved this question
		+ Give the conclusion they found an explain furhter relevant stuff for our paper
		
* Personally I would also like to see these questions answered when I read the introduction
	- What is the advantage of RL over other machine learning methods
		+ how does it differ with other methods
		+ for what problems is RL the ideal method
		+ for what problems would it be better to use another machine learning method
	- Give some real live high impact applications or examples where RL learning is implemented 
		+ these things can be fancy, we want to excite the reader with these things
	- Explain the disadvantages of RL and end with and highlight that the learning speed can be slow for complex programs
		+ you can look up some real number to give an idea
	- previous part could be followed with an introduction to ensemble methods and how they try to solve this learning speed problem
		+ explain what the concept behind it is
