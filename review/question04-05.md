## Answer

This is a professionally written report where the authors reproduced the results of their selected paper and also added a relevant extension to their work.
It should be better however,
that the explanation about risk curves was given in the methods part.
Very nice figures. 
As a small remark for figure 1,
it would have been a bit easier to have an visual representation of the legend instead of it being explained in the caption,
but this is only a small remark.
All questions that were asked in the introduction were answered and most of them were explained clearly.
