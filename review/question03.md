# 3) whether the methods are clearly explained (can the results be reproduced?)

Methods are very well described so that it is clear how to reproduce their work.
Not only do they write it in general pseudo-code,
they also provide a link to their Github repository,
making it possible to exactly replicate their work.
The methods are explained both in a conceptual and mathematical manner, 
making it easy to follow.
Finally, their example at the end was very helpful 
and helped to clear any remaining ambiguity.
