This is a professionally written report where the authors reproduced the results of their selected paper and also added a relevant extension to their work.

The introduction is very well written with the context and relevance of the work clearly stated.

Enough background is given to understand their presented work and the methods are very well described so that it is clear how to reproduce their work.

Main suggestions for improvement:
- You could have added a paragraph in your discussion mentioning: What are the limits of the model and how could it be extended?
- Statistical significance of the results. You could have done multiple simulations and add the empirical standard deviations of your results. 
- Do you believe that having 2 players and 4 rounds is representative of the climate change situation. Maybe adding more rounds and more players could change the results and be more significant for climate change.
- for the extension, wouldn't it be more relevant to add some risk for investment? Otherwise players could invest all their leftover money at each round since they know they will get back at the next round with some additional profit.
