* Explain that they use cumulative results and final results
    - That cumulative gives an idea about how fast the algo learns but graph would be better


* There was still some ambiguity in the article that could have been explained better
    - source code was not available (or we did not find it at least)
    - stuff they did not explain about the neural network that was needed for the implementation
        + I don't know exactly what stuff, can you help me out Nil?
    - not totally clear how final and cumulative score are implemented
    
    - Maybe at the end of all this negative notes, tell that it was still very interesting work and that we managed to find most things after searching for a while
    
* why neural nets do not converge
    - numerical errors
    - normal multiple iteration before the forward and backward propagation
    - something with experience replay
    
* Small maze
    - Very similar results
        + within standard deviation
    - we can tell something about the rank voting that there is still a minor bug that could have influence
