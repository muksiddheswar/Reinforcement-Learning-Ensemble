CAPTION SUTTON's DYNA MAZE.
Sutton's Dyna Maze. 
The maze consists of 54 tiles (6 rows x 9 columns).
Starting position is indicated by "S",
Goal position by "G".
Tiles that are coloured black depict walls.


CAPTION TABLE 1
Results of the small maze experiment.
Tabular learning rates (alpha and beta),
discount factor (gamma),
and greediness (G, inverse of Boltzmann temperature)
are shown for each algorithm.
Final and cumulative results 
were within standard deviation of the results obtained by Wiering 2007
(not shown).

CAPTION TABLE 2
Assessment of the effect of the discount factor parameter (gamma).
Tabular learning rates (alpha and beta),
discount factor (gamma),
and greediness (G, inverse of Boltzmann temperature)
are shown for SARSA and ACLA.
Final and cumulative results are significantly lower than when optimal discount factor is used.

CAPTION GRAPH 1
Evolution of total reward of the different algorithms on the small maze experiment.
All algorithms converged within 10,000 time steps.

CAPTION GRAPH 2
Evolution of total reward of the different algorithms on the maze with dynamic obstacles.
The neural networks are not able to converge for any of the algorithms.
This shown for QL-learning, SARSA, AC and QV-learning and is indicated by the oscillatory behaviour of the total reward.
