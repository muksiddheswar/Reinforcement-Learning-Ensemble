						Reinforcement Learning (RL) and  algorithms [1],  [2] are very suitable for learning to control an agent by letting it interact with  an  environment. 
			This paper describes several ensemble methods such as: Majority Voting (VM), Rank Voting, Boltzmann mulplication(BM) and Boltzmann Addition(BA) 
			that combine multiple different Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms which are: Q-Learning, Sarsa, Actor-Critic(AC), QV-Learning, and AC Learning Automaton
			in a single agent and the aim is to perform learning speed and final performance. We show  experiments on five maze problems of varying complexity.
			The results show that for different problems, there can be large performance differences between the different algorithms, and that  there  is  not  a  single 
			RL  algorithm  that  always  performs best, although The results indicate that the Boltzmann mulplication(BM) and Majority Voting(VM) ensembles significantly
			outperform the single RL algorithms.In this paper we did similar work like Ensemble Methodes for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation[3]. This one  
			propose several ensemble methods to learn a combined parameterized state-value function of multiple agents. For this purpose theTemporal-Difference(TD) and 
			Residual-Gradient(RG) update methods as well as a policy function is adapted to learn from joint decisions. These ensemble methods are applied to the simple 
			pencil-and-paper gameTic-Tac-Toe and show that an ensemble of three agents outperforms a single agent in terms of the Mean-Squared Error (MSE). Further the same 
			methods are applied  to learn the shortest path in a 20×20 maze and empirically show that the learning speed is faster and the resulting policy.
